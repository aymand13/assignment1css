                <p>
                    Imagine there's no <span style="color: #ff0000;">heaven</span><br>
                    It's easy if you try<br>
                    No <span style="color: #00ff00;">hell</span> below us<br>
                    Above us only <span style="color: #0000ff;">sky</span><br>
                    Imagine all the people living for today
                </p>
                <p>
                    Imagine there's no <span style="color: #ff0000;">countries</span><br>
                    It isn't hard to do<br>
                    Nothing to kill or die for<br>
                    And no <span style="color: #ff00ff;">religion</span>, too<br>
                    Imagine all the people<br>
                    Livin' life in peace
                </p>
                <p>
                    You<br>
                    You may say I'm a <span style="color: #ff0000;">dreamer</span><br>
                    But I'm not the only one<br>
                    I hope someday you'll join us<br>
                    And the world will be as one<br>
                    Imagine no <span style="color: #00ffff;">possessions</span><br>
                    I wonder if you can<br>
                    No need for <span style="color: #ffff00;">greed</span> or <span style="color: #00ff00;">hunger</span><br>
                    A <span style="color: #ff0000;">brotherhood</span> of man<br>
                    Imagine all the people<br>
                    Sharing all the world
                </p>
                <p>
                    You<br>
                    You may say I'm a <span style="color: #ff0000;">dreamer</span><br>
                    But I'm not the only one<br>
                    I hope someday you'll join us<br>
                    And the world will live as one
                </p>
